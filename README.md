# Abstract

Online-shopping has established itself as a colossal force in the world of retail - seemingly out of no
where. German retail giants from the early 2000s like Karstadt and Galeria Kaufhof were, despite
fusing into one company, not able to adapt to this and became dependent on subsidization from the
german government to remain operational - an unimaginable thought two decades ago. This data
warehousing project illustrates the development to the status quo and takes a deeper look at the
impact of online-shopping's growth on retail stores.

# Conclusions 

1. Grocery retailers appear to be unaffected, which suggests a niche.
  
2. Companies with the highest average revenue per employee have a much higher e-commerce share than companies with the lowest.
   
3. Exemplarily chosen data of giants of an industry and their online counterparts suggest a strong correlation between declining revenue and being mainly a retail vendor.

4. The percentage of online purchases and online customers keeps growing, even for food.

**The analysis of this project points towards the internet being a main contributor to retail's decline, however niches appear to still exist.**
